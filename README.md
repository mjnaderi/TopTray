# TopTray

Shows legacy tray icons of Gnome shell on top panel. Tested with Gnome 3.14.

Fork of http://94.247.144.115/repo/topicons/. Topicons didn't have an option to set icon size, so I added it.

This is just a try, without any warranty.

# Install

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:mjnaderi/TopTray.git
$ cd TopTray
$ make
```

You may need to restart the shell (`Alt + F2` then `r`), and enable extension using Gnome Tweak Tool.

# TODO

Reduce space between icons (Or add an option for it)
